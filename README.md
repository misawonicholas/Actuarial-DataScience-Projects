This repository contains various projects related to actuarial data science with a bias toward P & C insurance & Banking.

# Actuarial Data Science

Actuarial Data Science blends traditional actuarial science with modern data science techniques. This integration enables actuaries to gain insights from vast and complex datasets, make more accurate predictions, and devise innovative insurance products. Below are some topics that can be covered under Actuarial Data Science:

## Topics

- **Risk Modeling and Assessment**: Using machine learning techniques to predict and quantify risks, thereby assisting in pricing insurance products.
  
- **Claims Prediction**: Using machine learning models to predict the likelihood of claims based on historical data and customer profiles.
  
- **Fraud Detection**: Implementing algorithms to detect potentially fraudulent claims or activities using anomaly detection techniques.
  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzing and segmenting customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing, personalized product offerings, or determining risk profiles.
  
- **Customer Churn Analysis**: Predicting which policyholders are most likely not to renew their policies, allowing companies to take proactive retention actions.
  
- **Lifetime Value Prediction**: Estimating the net profit attributed to a customer's future relationship, which can guide retention and marketing strategies.
  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Using methods like ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM to predict future claims or cash flows.
  
- **Catastrophic Event Modeling**: Using advanced simulations to predict the financial implications of rare but severe events, such as natural disasters.
  
- **Telematics Analysis**: Assessing data from telematics devices in vehicles to determine driving habits and assign risk scores or discounts on automotive insurance.
  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Automating underwriting decisions or processing claims by analyzing textual data, such as medical reports.
  
- **Survival Analysis**: Assessing the expected time until an event occurs, like the termination of an insurance policy or a claim.
  
- **Reserving**: Using data science techniques to predict future liabilities or cash flows for insurance claims that have occurred but have not yet been settled.
  
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Using algorithms to allocate assets to maximise expected returns for a given level of risk.
  
- **Reinsurance Optimization**: Using data-driven approaches to determine optimal reinsurance structures and purchase strategies.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing customer feedback and reviews to gauge customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
  
- **Pricing Optimization**: Using advanced techniques to adjust pricing based on a wide range of factors beyond traditional risk parameters.
  
- **Health Analytics**: In health insurance, predicting the onset of diseases or conditions based on lifestyle data, medical records, and other factors.
  
- **Social Network Analysis**: Analyzing connections and interactions in a network (like social media) to determine influencers or predict claim propagation in interconnected risks.
